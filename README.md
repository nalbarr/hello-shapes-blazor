hello-shapes-blazor

This is my warm-up project to learn about Blazor.  I usually port on of my shapes projects as a small architecture spike to run a lean experiment prior to committing to a more complex project.

## What is Blazor?
Blazor is an experimental framework that Microsoft is advancing to empower next generation web appications with the benefits of a static typed language such as C#.  It was originated by Steve Sanderson of the Microsoft ASP.NET team as recently evangelized at Micrososft Build 2018 as part of upcoming .NET Core 2.1, etc product roadmap.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
