hello-shapes-blazor

This is my warm-up project to learn about Blazor.  I usually port on of my shapes projects as a small architecture spike to run a lean experiment prior to committing to a more complex project.

## What is Blazor?
Blazor is an experimental framework that Microsoft is advancing to empower next generation web appications with the benefits of a static typed language such as C#.  It was originated by Steve Sanderson of the Microsoft ASP.NET team as recently evangelized at Micrososft Build 2018 as part of upcoming future .NET Core 2.x product roadmap.

## Getting Started

These instructions are for using .NET Core on command line (tested on Mac, OSX).

### Prerequisites

You will need a specific version of .NET Core.  Shortly after Build 2018, .NET Core 2.1 RC was released.

```
.NET 
```

### Installing

- Download .NET Core

- Install Blazor project template
- Create .NET Core project
- Change to project directory
- Run app

```
dotnet new -i Microsoft.AspNetCore.Blazor.Templates
dotnet new blazor -o hello-shapes-blazor
cd hello-shapes-blazor
dotnet run
```

- View default app
- See scaffolded apps

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests
